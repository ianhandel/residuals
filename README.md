Create plot of two groups of normally distributed values showing group mean as horizontal line with dotted lines from points to mean.

[residuals.R](https://github.com/ianhandel/residuals/blob/master/residuals.R) was the first attempt.

[residuals2.R](https://github.com/ianhandel/residuals/blob/master/residuals2.R) starts with gathered group data. And uses three groups.

There's probably a much more elegant way to do this.
